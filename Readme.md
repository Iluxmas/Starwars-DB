# Application Star Wars Data Base

**Tech stack:** React.js, React-router, JavaScript

**Desription:** Project was done using React, mainly class components and also high-order-components.

**Featers:**

- Information is taken via API requests, designated component is responsible for this
- Selection of item from the list changes the address with react-router

After cloning, execute next commands to run the project - `npm i` to install dependencies, `npm start` to run page on port :8080

**Next plans**: Project is under development. Will be added soon:

- [X] Dummy image if no image recieved from API.
- [ ] Refactor class components to hooks.
- [ ] Webpack compilation
- [ ] Tests coverage.
